# üêõ Critical Bug Fixes - October 8, 2025

## Summary
Fixed 5 critical issues in the authentication system that were preventing proper Remember Me functionality, logout cookie clearing, user profile loading, and causing hydration errors.

---

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ OTP Verification Remember Me Support

**Problem:**
- OTP verification always used `remember_me=False`, creating session cookies
- Even when user checked Remember Me during login, cookies would become session-only after OTP
- After OTP verification, refresh_token had session ‚Üí 30 days, then reverted to session

**Root Cause:**
- `otps/mutation.py` hardcoded `remember_me=False` in `SecureTokenManager.set_secure_jwt_cookies()`
- Frontend stored remember_me in sessionStorage but never passed it to OTP verification

**Solution:**
Backend changes:
- Added `remember_me: Optional[bool] = False` to `VerifyOTPInput` in `otps/types.py`
- Updated `verify_otp` mutation to read `input.remember_me` and pass to `SecureTokenManager.set_secure_jwt_cookies()`
- Cookies now properly set based on user's Remember Me choice

Frontend changes:
- Added `rememberMe?: boolean` to `VerifyOTPRequestDto` in `types/auth/otp.tsx`
- Updated `otpApi.verifyOTP()` to pass `rememberMe` in GraphQL variables
- Updated `AuthContext.verifyOTP()` to retrieve `rememberMe` from sessionStorage and pass to API

**Files Modified:**
- `skillsync-be/otps/types.py` (line 26)
- `skillsync-be/otps/mutation.py` (lines 182-198)
- `skillsync-fe/types/auth/otp.tsx` (line 28)
- `skillsync-fe/api/auth/otp.tsx` (line 199)
- `skillsync-fe/context/AuthContext.tsx` (lines 634-649)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Login WITHOUT Remember Me ‚Üí Close browser ‚Üí Must re-login ‚úÖ
- [ ] Login WITH Remember Me ‚Üí Close browser ‚Üí Still logged in ‚úÖ
- [ ] Check DevTools: refresh_token shows "Session" when unchecked, "30 days" when checked ‚úÖ

### 2. ‚úÖ Logout Cookie Clearing

**Problem:**
- After logout, cookies remained in browser storage
- `clearAuthCookies()` was a no-op in frontend
- Backend logout mutation called `delete_cookie()` but domain didn't match

**Root Cause:**
- Cookies set with `domain='localhost'` in dev, but `delete_cookie()` didn't specify domain
- Domain mismatch prevented cookie deletion

**Solution:**
Backend changes:
- Updated `SecureTokenManager.clear_secure_cookies()` to match domain used in `set_secure_jwt_cookies()`
- Added `domain='localhost' if settings.DEBUG else None` to all `delete_cookie()` calls
- Added `samesite='Lax' if settings.DEBUG else 'Strict'` to match cookie settings

Frontend changes:
- Removed localStorage clearing (no longer used for auth)
- Added sessionStorage cleanup for pending-login/pending-signup
- Updated logout to redirect to `/signin` after successful backend call

**Files Modified:**
- `skillsync-be/auth/secure_utils.py` (lines 103-122)
- `skillsync-fe/api/auth/signin.tsx` (lines 229-258)
- `skillsync-fe/context/AuthContext.tsx` (lines 490-520)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Login ‚Üí Logout ‚Üí Check DevTools ‚Üí All cookies cleared (refresh_token, client_fp, fp_hash) ‚úÖ
- [ ] After logout ‚Üí Try accessing /dashboard ‚Üí Redirected to /signin ‚úÖ

### 3. ‚úÖ Wrong User Profile After Login

**Problem:**
- After login, wrong user profile appeared (e.g., `test@skillsync.com` instead of new user)
- Session restore loaded old/cached user data

**Root Cause:**
- `authApi.getProfile()` called `users { users { ... } }` query
- This returns ALL users and took `users[0]` (first user in database)
- Should have called `auth { me { ... } }` to get CURRENT authenticated user

**Solution:**
- Changed GraphQL query from `users { users { ... } }` to `auth { me { ... } }`
- Backend `auth.me` query already exists and returns authenticated user
- Added `firstName` and `lastName` fields to query
- Updated return mapping to use actual user data (not first user)

**Files Modified:**
- `skillsync-fe/api/auth/signin.tsx` (lines 396-436)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Login as new user ‚Üí Verify correct email/role appears ‚úÖ
- [ ] Session restore ‚Üí Verify current user loaded (not cached) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Multiple users in DB ‚Üí Each user sees their own profile ‚úÖ

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Hydration Mismatch Error

**Problem:**
- Console error: `Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client`
- Error pointed to Navigation component theme toggle (Sun vs Moon icon)

**Root Cause:**
- `useTheme()` hook returns `undefined` during SSR
- Client-side: `theme` is read from localStorage ‚Üí renders Moon or Sun
- Server-side: `theme` is undefined ‚Üí renders different icon
- React detected mismatch and threw error

**Solution:**
- Added `mounted` state with `useEffect(() => setMounted(true), [])`
- Show neutral state (Sun icon) during SSR (before mount)
- After mount, show animated theme toggle based on actual theme
- Prevents SSR/client mismatch by waiting for hydration

**Files Modified:**
- `skillsync-fe/components/Navigation.tsx` (lines 1-25, 100-127)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Navigate to any page ‚Üí No hydration errors in console ‚úÖ
- [ ] Theme toggle works correctly after page load ‚úÖ
- [ ] View page source ‚Üí Sun icon rendered (SSR) ‚úÖ

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Signin Page Redirect (Bonus Fix)

**Problem:**
- After logout, attempting to access `/signin` caused redirect issues
- AuthContext wasn't properly clearing redirect state

**Solution:**
- Updated logout to set `isRedirecting: false` after state clear
- Added 100ms delay before redirect to allow state updates
- Redirect explicitly to `/signin` (not homepage)

**Files Modified:**
- `skillsync-fe/context/AuthContext.tsx` (lines 490-520)

## üìä Impact Analysis

### Security Improvements ‚úÖ
- Logout now properly clears all HTTP-only cookies (prevents session hijacking)
- Remember Me properly controlled by user choice (session vs persistent)
- All auth data remains in HTTP-only cookies (XSS protection maintained)

### User Experience Improvements ‚úÖ
- Remember Me works as expected (industry standard behavior)
- Correct user profile always loaded (no wrong user confusion)
- No hydration errors (cleaner console, better performance)
- Logout fully clears session (prevents ghost sessions)

### Code Quality Improvements ‚úÖ
- Removed dead code (`clearAuthCookies()` no-op function)
- Fixed GraphQL query to use correct endpoint (`auth.me` vs `users.users`)
- Added proper SSR handling for theme toggle
- Improved error handling in logout flow

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### For Developers
1. **Clear your cookies** before testing:
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí Delete all for localhost
   
2. **Test both scenarios**:
   - Remember Me OFF (default): Session cookies
   - Remember Me ON: Persistent cookies (30 days)
   
3. **Verify backend logs**:
   - Look for: `‚úÖ Tokens generated for {email} after OTP verification (remember_me={True/False})`
   - Should show correct remember_me value

### For Users
- No action required
- Existing sessions will continue to work
- Next login will use new Remember Me behavior
