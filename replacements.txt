# replacements.txt used for git-filter-repo to remove secrets
# DO NOT commit real secrets here. This file previously contained a leaked Resend API key
# which has now been removed from history. Keep this file as a template only.

# Example format (do NOT include the actual secret):
# literal:<SECRET_TO_REMOVE>==>[REDACTED]

# If you need to run git-filter-repo again, populate replacements.txt locally (not committed)
# with the exact literal to replace, then run:
# python -m git_filter_repo --force --replace-text replacements.txt
