## 🔒 Security Verification

### ✅ What Was Fixed

**Question**: "Can we rely on AuthContext instead of middleware?"

**Answer**: YES! Much more secure.

**Key Changes**:
- ❌ **Removed** non-HTTP-only `user-role` cookie (XSS vulnerability)
- ✅ **All cookies now HTTP-only** (maximum security)
- ✅ **Access tokens in memory only** (React state, cleared on refresh)
- ✅ **Refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies** (JavaScript cannot access)

### Test Security Implementation

**Step 1: Login**
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. Enter credentials
3. **Uncheck** Remember Me
4. Click Login
5. Enter OTP code

**Step 2: Check Cookies**
1. Press F12 → **Application** → **Cookies** → **localhost**

**Expected (3 HTTP-only cookies)**:
```
✅ refresh_token: HttpOnly ✓, Secure ✓, SameSite=Strict
✅ client_fp: HttpOnly ✓, Secure ✓, SameSite=Strict
✅ fp_hash: HttpOnly ✓, Secure ✓, SameSite=Strict
```

**Must NOT see**:
```
❌ user-role cookie (removed - was security vulnerability)
❌ auth-token cookie (removed - tokens in memory only)
❌ access_token cookie (never created - memory only)
```

**Step 3: Verify JavaScript Cannot Access Auth Cookies**

Open browser console and run:
```javascript
document.cookie
// Should NOT show: refresh_token, client_fp, fp_hash
// (They're HTTP-only, JavaScript can't access them)
```

**Expected**: Only non-HTTP-only cookies visible (if any).

**Step 4: Check localStorage/sessionStorage**

Run in console:
```javascript
// Check localStorage
console.log(localStorage.getItem('accessToken')); // Should be null
console.log(localStorage.getItem('refreshToken')); // Should be null

// Check sessionStorage
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('accessToken')); // Should be null
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('refreshToken')); // Should be null
```

**Expected**: All `null` (tokens only in memory/React state).

**✅ Success Indicators**:
- All 3 auth cookies are HTTP-only ✅
- No `user-role` or `auth-token` cookies ✅
- No tokens in localStorage/sessionStorage ✅
- JavaScript cannot read refresh tokens ✅

## 🔄 Remember Me Testing

### Test 1: Remember Me OFF (Session Cookies)

**Step 1: Login Without Remember Me**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/signin`
2. Enter credentials
3. **UNCHECK** Remember Me ❌
4. Click "Sign In"
5. Enter OTP and verify

**Step 2: Check Cookie Duration**
1. Press F12 → **Application** → **Cookies**
2. Check `refresh_token` cookie

**Expected**:
```
✅ Expires: "Session" (cookie deleted when browser closes)
✅ HttpOnly: true
✅ Secure: true (in production)
✅ SameSite: Strict
```

**Step 3: Close Browser & Test Logout**
1. **Close ALL browser windows** (completely exit)
2. **Reopen browser**
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

**Expected**: 
- ✅ Redirected to `/signin` (logged out)
- ✅ Cookies deleted (session ended)

**Backend Logs Should Show**:
```
✅ Tokens generated for {email} after OTP verification (remember_me=False)
✅ Secure cookies set with session expiry (max_age=None)
```

---

### Test 2: Remember Me ON (Persistent Cookies)

**Step 1: Login With Remember Me**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/signin`
2. Enter credentials
3. **CHECK** Remember Me ✅
4. Click "Sign In"
5. Enter OTP and verify

**Step 2: Check Cookie Duration**
1. Press F12 → **Application** → **Cookies**
2. Check `refresh_token` cookie

**Expected**:
```
✅ Expires: ~30 days from now (e.g., November 9, 2025)
✅ HttpOnly: true
✅ Secure: true (in production)
✅ SameSite: Strict
```

**Step 3: Close Browser & Test Persistence**
1. **Close ALL browser windows** (completely exit)
2. **Reopen browser**
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

**Expected**:
- ✅ Loads dashboard immediately (still logged in)
- ✅ Console shows: "Session restored from HTTP-only cookie"
- ✅ Cookies still present (persistent)

**Backend Logs Should Show**:
```
✅ Tokens generated for {email} after OTP verification (remember_me=True)
✅ Secure cookies set with 30-day expiry (max_age=2592000)
```

## 🎯 Session Management Testing

### Test 1: Logout Clears All Cookies

**Steps**:
1. Login (with or without Remember Me)
2. Click "Logout" button
3. Check DevTools → Application → Cookies

**Expected**:
```
❌ refresh_token: DELETED
❌ client_fp: DELETED
❌ fp_hash: DELETED
```

**Verify Cannot Access Protected Routes**:
1. Try going to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
2. **Expected**: Redirected to `/signin`

---

### Test 2: Correct User Profile

**Steps**:
1. Login as **User A**
2. Check console: "User profile loaded successfully: { role: '...', email: 'userA@...' }"
3. Logout
4. Login as **User B**

**Expected**: Should see User B's profile (NOT User A's)

---

### Test 3: Session Restoration

**Steps**:
1. Login as User A (with Remember Me ON)
2. Close browser completely
3. Reopen browser
4. Go to app

**Expected Console Logs**:
```
✅ Session restored from HTTP-only cookie
👤 User profile loaded successfully: { email: 'userA@...' }
🚀 Redirecting based on role: ...
```

**Must NOT show**: Any other user's email or profile data.

---

### Test 4: Token Refresh

**Steps**:
1. Login and wait 5+ minutes (access token expires after 5 minutes)
2. Navigate to different page
3. Check console and network tab

**Expected**:
- ✅ Automatic token refresh triggered
- ✅ New access token received
- ✅ HTTP-only cookies rotated (old refresh token blacklisted)
- ✅ No user interruption

**Backend Logs**:
```
✅ Token refresh successful for {email}
✅ Old refresh token blacklisted
✅ New cookies set
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cookies Not Setting

**Symptoms**: No cookies in DevTools after login.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify backend running on `http://localhost:8000` (not 127.0.0.1)
2. Verify frontend running on `http://localhost:3000`
3. Check CORS settings in backend `settings/dev.py`:
   ```python
   CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
       "http://localhost:3000",
   ]
   CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True
   ```
4. Clear all cookies and try again

---

### Issue: Wrong User Profile

**Symptoms**: Seeing another user's data after login.

**Solutions**:
1. Clear browser cookies completely
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Login again
4. Check console: Should call `auth { me { ... } }` query
5. Verify backend `auth/query.py` returns correct user from token

---

### Issue: Session Not Persisting (Remember Me ON)

**Symptoms**: Logged out after browser close despite Remember Me checked.

**Solutions**:
1. Check cookie expiry in DevTools:
   - Should be ~30 days, not "Session"
2. Check backend logs for "remember_me=True"
3. Verify `set_secure_jwt_cookies` in `auth/secure_utils.py`:
   ```python
   if remember_me:
       max_age = int(settings.NINJA_JWT['REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME_REMEMBER'].total_seconds())
   else:
       max_age = None  # Session cookie
   ```
4. Check `config/security.py`:
   ```python
   'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME_REMEMBER': timedelta(days=30),
   ```

---

### Issue: Logout Doesn't Clear Cookies

**Symptoms**: Cookies still present after logout.

**Solutions**:
1. Check backend logs: Should see "Logout successful"
2. Verify `clear_secure_cookies()` in `auth/mutation.py`:
   ```python
   SecureTokenManager.clear_secure_cookies(info.context.response)
   ```
3. Check `domain='localhost'` in cookie settings
4. Try manual cookie deletion in DevTools
5. Hard refresh page

---

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized After Login

**Symptoms**: Immediate logout or 401 errors after successful login.

**Solutions**:
1. Check access token is being sent in requests:
   - Network tab → Request Headers → `Authorization: Bearer ...`
2. Verify Apollo Client `authLink` in `lib/apollo-client.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
       const token = getAccessTokenFromMemory();
       return {
           headers: {
               ...headers,
               authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : "",
           }
       };
   });
   ```
3. Check AuthContext is providing access token
4. Verify token not expired (5-minute lifetime)
